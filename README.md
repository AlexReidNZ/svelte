# Gamedle
Gamedle is a web application consisting of two major features: a suggestor for finding new games with filters and a guessing game inspired by games like Wordle.

## How To Run This Project:
 - Open the repo in VS code
 - open a new terminal
 - enter the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Technologies Used
This project was developed using Sveltekit.
The data used for the suggestor was generated by ChatGPT, and the data used for the game is retrieved from the [Free To Game API](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc).

## Know Issues
 - When game descriptions have the title more than once, only the first instance of the title is hidden.

## Future Roadmap
 - A more diverse dataset to use for the game.
 - Images for the games in the suggestor.
 - Better filtering by platform.
 - Show the player their previous guesses.

## Site design analysis
